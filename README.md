Passionate about programming and being able to help your company.

### About me

At 17 years old, I have skills as a front-end programmer, as well as some experience in backend programming. My interest in programming was sparked at the age of 10 when I began learning JavaScript. That was the starting point that made me fall in love with the world of programming.
